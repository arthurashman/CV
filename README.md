I am a curious and versatile junior software developer who loves creative problem solving and building value-driven products. Passionate about agile processes and working in cross-functional teams, my aim is to find a work environment where I can continue exploring forward-thinking ways of working. I am looking for opportunities where I can build on my knowledge and hone my craft in best practice software development.
## Skills

#### Communication and Stakeholder Management

Coming from a background in medicine, patient communication and empathy were key, and explicitly taught. I have further developed these skills professionally in subsequent people-focussed roles building up my ability to work fluidly in teams, provide and receive valuable feedback, and manage relationships with clients and colleagues alike.


#### Problem Solving

My approach to problem solving is both analytical and creative. Approaching problems with both logical and lateral thought, I am able to resolve blockers and devise novel solutions. I thrive when given the opportunity to approach a problem imaginatively and experiment in a safe environment.  

#### Fast Learner

I am ambitious to learn and grow, and have a sustained curiosity that always leads me to the next question. My ability to learn quickly has proven invaluable at Makers Academy and allows for me to adapt to any given setting.
